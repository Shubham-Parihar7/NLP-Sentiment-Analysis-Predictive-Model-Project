# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Predictive-Model-Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment.

## Project Workflow

1. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Tokenization
   - Lowercasing
   - Stemming (using the Porter Stemmer)
   
2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - Bag of Words (BoW) vectorization was used to convert textual data into numerical format for model training.

3. **Models Applied**:  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Naive Bayes  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - Accuracy  
   - F1 Score  
   - Cross-Validation to ensure generalization

## Results
- **Best Performing Model**: Logistic Regression
  - Test Accuracy: **80.5%**
  - F1 Score: **0.79**
  - Cross-Validation Accuracy: **79.3%**

## Conclusion
- The Logistic Regression model provided the best balance of performance and generalization.
- This project helped deepen my understanding of NLP techniques like text vectorization and classification algorithms.
- I automated the process of model creation, training, testing, and evaluation through custom Python functions.
